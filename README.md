# Harvard Course Enrollment
This repository looks at Harvard Course Enrollment for the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 Semesters. For courses offered both of
these semesters, a histogram is created showing the percent change in undergraduate student enrollment. This graphic is also
restricted to looking at courses for which there is more than one undergraduate student enrolled and for which there are more
undergraduate students than graduate students. Most courses saw modest enrollment changes, though some saw massive percent
increases. The published graphic can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/christophermilne/harvard_course_enrollment).
